# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
A ML project utilizing CNN for breast cancer detection through image processing. Achieved an accuracy of 97% using a dataset from Kaggle, where images were manually structured and processed for feature extraction with CNN, followed by classification using SVM.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains raw images. To prepare the data for analysis, we manually structured and processed the images.

1. **Data Preparation:** Raw images were manually structured to prepare them for feature extraction.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were employed for extracting features from the images.
3. **Classification:** Support Vector Machines (SVM) were utilized for classifying images into healthy and unhealthy categories based on the extracted features.

## Results
The approach yielded an accuracy of 97% in detecting breast cancer from the images.
